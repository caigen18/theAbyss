Killshot

1/1000 of all value derived from Abyss operations will be put into the Killshot.

The Killshot is a 50x short situated on the Void protocol, ever-growing,
on stablecoins - relatively weighted by token value in circulation.
That is to say, once the Void begins to algorithmically spawn new stable markets,
the Killshot will allocate a proportional amount of value to each stable perpetual that’s created.

Why Perps?

The case for perpetuals instead of expiring futures is that, while the downside
of holding a short on a perpetual is that you might lose some of your equity
if shorts need to pay longs (negative funding rate), this is equally offset
by the amount of time that the shorts will spend being paid by longs (positive funding rate).
Comparatively, expiring futures have no funding rate but once they’re settled
at expiry one would need to reallocate and reposition themselves in that newly
spawned futures contract - paying fees each time. In the perp markets, we can
maintain a single position and having had paid fees once on each leg of the position,
not needing to pay fees again.

The Abyss will also be deploying this strategy on non-US stables, like ones based on Yuan.

Why?

The theory here is that, while holding stablecoins, we can assume two things:

1.	The price will never move much higher than $1, due to the nature of stables.
a.	We can therein assume a 50x short, especially if entered at say 1.0002, will never liquidate as the value will almost certainly never rise by a whole 2%
b.	Indeed, backtesting stable perpetuals on centralized exchanges shows us this doesn’t happen
2.	The price may - eventually, in worst-case scenario - sink to 0
a.	This is a doom and gloom situation, and doesn’t speak well for crypto as a whole, but if USDT/USD markets on centralized exchanges were to crash - say, due to regulators moving to control stables and subjugate crypto holders - there will be a brief moment before delisting where there is unlimited upwards potential
b.	Should we have, say, $100000 on a 50x short at 1.0002, and the price falls even to 0.85 - that’s 15% plus a bit * 50 * 100000 = $750 000. This is let alone, say, a 25 or 50% move - skyrocketing the revenues and profit margin up to, hear me out here, read closely: $2.5million.
3.	This is now an absolutely riskless way to bet on the eventual certainty that USDT - or other stables, collectively or one by one, could generate returns in the 25x, 50x, 100x - in the span of minutes.

Yeah but like, what’re the chances?

The internet is awash with warnings and - one could honestly say - predictions
surrounding different stablecoins in different countries.
The future is certainly bleak - why not bet on it? With a fraction of our funds,
we’ll be betting against the rise of stables and those that control them - and benefiting
from the absolute and disorderly chaos that would pursue on that day, those days,
or countless events in the future where a token or coin pegged to a fiat will eventually die.

Meaning?

We can - singlehandedly - affect the price of stablecoins throughout markets,
with the more and more shorts we place on the Void. What this means to say is that,
like the mechanics of the Abyss destroying tokens that are voted on by users,
when we burn the supply on the exchange we have an immediate effect on price
that ripples across the internet - and opportunistic folks around the world will
capitalize on that by buying low, selling high, and bringing the prices closer
together by filling up that new gap. With the killshot, we’re slowly and steadily
reducing the price of stables on our markets - attracting traders who want to capitalize
on that within the Void exchange as well as among exchanges that list these stables,
as spot or derivatives. It’s a hedge on humanity.

Mechanics of Supply and Demand

Indeed, Huobi lists USDT with 1000x leverage - think of that!
For every 0.0001 movement on the Void you can capitalize $10 for each of your $1
when you buy and sell the difference among the exchanges. It’s truly a thing of beauty.

As we sink and sink stable prices, we inherently serve our own purpose of profiting
- even marginally - on our shorts. Each and every dollar and each and every ether and
each and every BTC sunk into the Killshot - by nature of supply and
demand - is a self-fulfilling prophecy, bringing the price ever so much lower
and building and building our return profile in sweet, sweet %s of equity.
