# How to build

You can't clone the Abyss. There is only one Abyss. I will vehemently and aggressively defend our IP using extreme measures. I shape fates and crush dudes. Please be prepared to get raided and looted as soon as you come on my radar.

# Welcome to theAbyss

ABY is a *non-inflationary* *experimental* chaos inducing *cryptocurrency* that is designed to control the Abyss, the primary and only DAE to execute profit-generating strategies autonomously with a completely decentralized approach.

Ingrained into basically every existing strategy-executing platform, a team or a single developer, solely responsible for determining how locked funds are used to generate ROI is hazardous to the health of the fund as it grows, as it creates flawed incentives, and invites mistakes to be made. The Abyss does away with this dynamic and instead opts for one with decentralized governance.

Only ABY token holders will be able to provide strategy contracts and vote on what goes live and when, in order to decentralize autonomous strategy execution and the further evolution of the protocol.

# Initial Distribution

The baseq3 team @ the Abyss is kickstarting the initial distribution with an ABY materialization event. Contribute ETH to the Abyss Fair Launch smart contract to receive tokens, and the contributed ETH will be matched and added to the Abyss.

# Deflationary **EVERYTHING**

Farming tokens have a problem for their owners. To keep users farming, they have to mint more ever more coins. This completely destroys the value of the underlying token, due to excessive inflation. It's easy to find examples of this across the DeFi ecosystem.

Our solution is the Abyss eternal, and it is quite simply the most brilliant idea in the known universe in only three easy-to-write-down steps:

1. Accommodate actual and innovative strategies as pools for users and funnel all yield into the CHARON DAO everybody can interact with, but only ABY token holders can influence, in turn awarding OBOL tokens to all users.

2. Feed the Abyss tokens you voted on with the governance induced by ABY and watch it cause havoc on the market while popping out NFTs with the screaming souls of the devs who

3. Propagate the OBOL ecosystem and expand the providence of the Abyss by expanding into the Void.

This simple process means that those holding ABY tokens are the only people on the planet, able to exert some form of control over /potentially/ the biggest Decentralized Autonomous Entity/burnpool on the ethereum network.

# Keeping **Ecosystems** system-focused:

The holdings of CHARON and the weight of the bags it carries can only go up given time. Making sure the price of OBOL keeps pace is therefore a logical priority and to that extent, the DAO is able to add/remove OBOL tokens from circulation with a part of its' holdings, at any given time.

The incentive to generate OBOL is tied to several mechanisms. Propagating token removal plays a significant role in this but the primary mechanic to OBOL is the reward system it accommodates and the slew of new derivative-based instruments that can be built on top.

This will guarantee a stable market, giving holders and farmers an incentive to stay tied to the protocol.

# **Real Governance**

The Abyss was engineered to accommodate actual governance. Holders of ABY tokens hold final decisions over almost everything, from developer fees, to deciding on the fee approver contract, adding new pools, rebalancing, and even disabling parts of the Abyss ecosystem. The holdings of the Abyss itself, are the only thing beyond the touch of mortals.

If the ABY holders decide the Abyss protocol should remove a portion of the circulating supply of YFI, we can use the profits we've accrued and stored with CHARON to buy and remove that portion of YFI and mint a NFT while we're at it.

This creates an incentive to hold even more ABY by the holders of any token on the ethereum blockchain. Let the governance begin. But for real this time.

# **36669 ABY Forever**

There's absolutely no way to create new ABY tokens and there's absolutely no known method of controlling the Abyss without holding ABY, period.

36669 ABY in total supply,
30000 tokens up for sale,
6669k reserved for liquidity lock and marketing fund.

There is/was only ever one materialization event ever to occur. The unsold ABY tokens are sent to the Abyss to be held forever. Any additional ABY tokens can be locked in the Abyss upon governance
decision.
